<h1>NBA Trivia Game!</h1>

This game is dedicated to Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna who tragically passed away while I was building this game. Growing up
a huge Trail Blazers fan I loved to hate him but respected his game so much. I looked forward to seeing him in retirement. He was
doing so much good. It hurts so bad and I am heart broken. #Mambaentality! #KB824

In this assignment, You'll create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

* The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

  * The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

* Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.
